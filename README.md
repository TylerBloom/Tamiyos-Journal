The comprehensive rules (the CR) for Magic: the Gathering are created, maintained, and distributed by Wizards of the Coast. This repository is not associated with WotC.

# About
This project contains a copy of the comprehensive rules for Magic: the Gathering and serves two major roles. The first is to track the changes to the CR over time. The second is to track issues and ambiguities in the CR while providing an open forum to discuss. These issues and discussions here are not, to the knowledge of the maintainers, used to inform changes to the CR. Rather, any [O]fficial answers contained in the issue threads are the generally agreed upon rulings of the judge community. Others in the judge community can use these answers as they see fit.

# Contributing
If you believe you have found a corner case/discrepancy/ambiguities in the rules, please open an issue. If there is a discussion that coalesces around an answer, that issue will be marked as [O]fficial. Moreover, feel free to open a PR to correct the issue. While these will not be merged directly, they will help track when there are possible relevant changes to the CR.

Note, this project should not be used for general rules questions. Such issues will be closed with or without discussion.
